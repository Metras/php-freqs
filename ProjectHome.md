phpFreqs is a solution for VHF, Ham and Radio Scanner Users.

The system will be able to store radio frequencies in a database to be searchable by users.

It will allow for such things as Identifiying Radio Stations in a particular city.
Ideally a typical search for "Rock Music" in "Calgary" under category "Radio Station" would return "CJAY92, FM, 92.1MHz"

Another use will be something like "Weather Broadcast" in "Alberta" would return "NOAA, VHF, 162.400MHz"

This is a global database application that will be able to scale as small as a local club or as large as an international reference.

The engine will incorporate user interactions as well as a community driven moderation system to lessen burden and maintenance time of administrators.
